Bora, Olivia, Nathaniel, and Kidus's final project.

The objective of this program is to create a user-friendly software where the user can
create an account and upload their resume to our cloud servers. From there, their resume
will be analyzed using Google's Natural Language API to make sure they have a correctly formatted resume
by checking their word choice and the overall format the resume is written in.
